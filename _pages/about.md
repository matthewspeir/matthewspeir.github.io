I'm a bioinformatician turned historian. This is my personal website, obviously any opinions expressed here are my own.

Professional life
=====

I graduated from the University of California Santa Cruz in 2013 with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology with a minor in Bioinformatics. After graduating, I started with the [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu) group in July 2013 where I performed software/data quality assurance and user support. In 2017, I started to split my time between the UCSC Genome Browser and two other projects the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) [Stem Cell Hub (SC Hub)](https://cirm.ucsc.edu) and the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) [Data Coordination Platform (DCP)](https://data.humancellatlas.org). For the SC Hub, I was resposible for the web design and static content of the website in addition to software quality assurance. For the HCA DCP, I was involved in User Experience (UX) research. As part of the DCP UX team, I assisted in carrying out a handful of research projects such as a deep-dive into wet-lab, bench scientists and their needs as well as a beta test of the DCP1 Data Portal and survey of data contributors. After the SC Hub project ended in 2019, I began on the [UCSC Cell Browser](https://cells.ucsc.edu), where I am a data wrangler and also do software quality assurance and user support. 

What's next: History!
=====

Currently, I am attempting to pursue a career in the historical sciences, specifically the history of science. I am currently enrolled at Sacramento City College where I am taking history courses and pursuing an Associates for Transfer in History. I plan to apply to Masters Programs in the History of Science or more general History in late 2021 and early 2022. 

Personal life
=====

Outside of work, I enjoy playing board and video games with my partner as well as reading (comic books, science fiction, non-fiction, etc.). We also have a little dog and go on regular bike rides around the city of Davis.
